# Hey 👋 <br/>

## Who am I?<br/>
Well hey, I'm Jeroen. I'm a fullstack (React (Native), Node, Typescript) developer. I started out as a Computer Science student, but after a few years I decided to change to web. Haven't look back since. <br />
I live near Utrecht, The Netherlands. I really wanna move to New York within a few years though. I'm 24 years old and I recently graduated in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht

## What I've been working on?<br/>
I've been working on various things.<br/>
🥙 My job at [On Air](https://onair.events)<br/>
📅 My side project called [Dashy](https://dashy.me). Something beautiful is in the works.<br/>
🙋🏻‍♂️ My personal website at [jeroenvanhattem.io](https://jeroenvanhattem.io). I made this website while learning React, so it doesn't look that good at the moment.<br/>

Aside from coding, I also do the following things.<br/>
