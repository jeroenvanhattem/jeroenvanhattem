# Hey 👋 <br/>

## Who am I?<br/>
Well hey, I'm Jeroen. I'm a fullstack (React (Native), Node, Typescript) developer. I started out as a Computer Science student, but after a few years I decided to change to software development. Haven't look back since. <br />
I live near Utrecht, The Netherlands. I'm 25 years old and I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht

## What I've been working on?<br/>
I've been working on various things.<br/>
<!--📅 🥙 My job at [On Air](https://onair.events)<br/-->
🏋️ My fitness/social media app, [ApolloFit](https://apollofit.app).<br/>
🙋🏻‍♂️ My personal website at [jeroenvanhattem.io](https://jeroenvanhattem.io). I made this website while learning React, so it doesn't look that good at the moment and I haven't revisited the code since 🙃.<br/>

Aside from coding, I also do the following things.<br/>
⚽ I do a lot of sports, including going to the gym and playing football<br/>
❌ I regularly go to Ajax matches <br />
⛰️ I like travelling. Recently I went on a California roadtrip! <br />
