# Hey

## Who am I?
Well hey, I'm Jeroen. I'm a fullstack (React, Node, Typescript) developer. Also going to learn React Native in the near future! I started out as a Computer Science student, but after a few years I decided to change to web. Haven't look back since.

## What I've been working on?
I've been working on various things.
🥙 My internship at [Foodsy](https://foodsy.eu), a food pre-order app and website.
📅 My side project called [Dashy](https://dashy-app.com), the most customizable personal dashboard.
🙋🏻‍♂️ My personal website at [jeroenvanhattem.io](https://jeroenvanhattem.io). I made this website while learning React, so it doesn't look that good at the moment.

Aside from coding, I also do the following things.
⚽ I play football
🎤 I make music, you can check me out on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Egoy0UuRKksBWzmGYzd68?si=ZFvkJ25fTzWuurChMoAGTA&dl_branch=1), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/yeno/1495372718) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZkKPcjFB8UpoZ2y6bC1rWw)
